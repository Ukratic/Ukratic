#### 👋 Hi, I’m @Ukratic -> [My Portfolio](https://ukratic.github.io/)

- My current personal projects are split between a focus on OSINT investigations and signal analysis.
- I have a few OSINT scripts 👾[in this repo](https://github.com/Ukratic/osint_scripts).
- My projects for the Jedha Bootcamp Data Science certification are 🏫[here](https://github.com/Ukratic/Jedha_fullstack) and 🌲[there](https://github.com/Ukratic/Protection-Forests).
- A GUI for asynchronous signal analysis : 📡[SigAnTo](https://github.com/Ukratic/Siganto).
