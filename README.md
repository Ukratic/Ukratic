#### 👋 Hi, I’m @Ukratic -> [My Portfolio](https://ukratic.github.io/)

- 🤓 My current personal projects are split between a focus on OSINT investigations and LoRaWan development. More coming soon.
- 🌲 I worked with a team on an analysis of the state of protective forests in Switzerland, using a wide range of data and metrics. <br>
